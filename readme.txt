Pre-Compliance Accreditation Tool for Python

I am demonstrating a Python based program for scanning and re-mediating security findings on Windows and Linux based information systems. PCAT2PY (Pre-Compliance Accreditation Tool for Python) is capable of running against remote systems as a trusted user or running locally against a system with administrative privileges. Following a scan or re-mediation using PCAT2PY, a report, formatted as HTML, is produced indicating the compliance, standard output, identification, and discussion of every finding that was scanned or re-mediated.
